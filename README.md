# react-starter
Quick starter kit for a minimal isomorphic React.js setup built with Webpack.
It has only the required files for a nice React experience, nothing more, nothing less.

### Installation
Run `npm install` to get things started.

### For development
Run `npm run dev` to run a server at `http://localhost:3000`. 
Every change you make to your React components will be updated directly in the browser.

### For production
* Run `npm run build` to build the assets.
* Run `npm run server` to run a simple server and browse to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Where to go from here...
* Add Relay.js to your system, for persisting data
* Add a router like React Router or Router5
* Add some linting tools to analyze your code
* Add styling with Css Modules or any other package for inline styling
